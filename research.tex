    {\textbf{Tracing Closed Curves with Epicycles}}, Supervisor: Prof. S. K. Kaushik}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this paper me and my co-authors introduce the fundamental concepts of Fourier series and transforms (continuous and discrete), delving into their mathematical formulations, properties and applications.
        \item We also include a python program that performs the discrete Fourier transform to animate tracing of curves.
    \end{itemize}
