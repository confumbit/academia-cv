    {\textbf{On Computable Normed Almost Linear Spaces}}}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We study the notion of a computable normed almost linear space and
              examine some results of the theory of operators in normed almost linear
              spaces in the context of computability.  Specifically, we establish the
              effectivity of the Inverse Mapping Theorem in the normed almost linear
              spaces.
    \end{itemize}

    {\textbf{Computable Analysis: Mathematical Foundations and Computability of Real Functions Using The TTE Approach}}}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Co-authored with Sujit Kumar (first author), this paper gives a
              simple introduction to computable analysis, specifically, the
              representations-based approach. We introduce naming systems,
              admissible representations, along with computability on several
              objects used in real analysis. We end with showing the
              computability of differentiation and the absence of it in
              integration.
    \end{itemize}
